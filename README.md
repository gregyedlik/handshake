# handshake
This project is about understanding the handshake process used in Bosch e-bike systems, with the aim of producing compatible BMS boards.

main.py

This program can be used to automatically record handshakes from a working system.

repetitions.py

The scripts in this file were used to quantify the progress in recording handshakes, and trying to recognise patterns.

crosscheck.py

This script is about comparing the data recorded from two different batteries. (Takes a long time to run!!)

crosscheck.txt

This is the output of crosscheck.py. It shows the differences in the answers to challanges between different batteries.

list_scott.csv

This file contains handshakes recorded from one battery.

list_badconnector.csv
This file contains handshakes recorded from another battery.
